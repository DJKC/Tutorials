Debugging Functions

Continue - program executes until it reaches a breakpoint
Step in - execute the next line of code and wait
Step over - executes the next line of code. If next line is a function, it executes then resumes pause
Step out - Executes remaining lines of current function and pauses after it executes
Breakpoints - debugger will pause on user set breakpoints , usually for variable value inspection
