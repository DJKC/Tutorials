# AutomateBoringStuff

Al Sweigart's book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"
was one I heard great things about. Initially I started
following the video series on https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/

It was great but as I looked at the website (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc),
the text version of the chapter held much more information.
This repo is my following along with his code. I may type
almost exactly the code he types, but I make sure to
understand the code adding comments in to help future me when I reread the file.

The content he has made available either through the Udemy video series
or his website, is IMMENSELY valuable and useful for anyone
really wanting to write productive code that does useful tasks.
